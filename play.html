    <h2>The Tempest</h2>
    <h3>SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise</h3>
    <p>
        of thunder and lightning heard.
    <p><i>Enter a Master and a Boatswain</i></p>

    <p>
    <h5>Master</h5>
    Boatswain!</p>
    <p>
    <h5>Boatswain</h5>
    Here, master: what cheer?
    </p>
    <p>
    <h5>Master</h5>
    Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
    or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.</p>
    <p><i>Exit</i></p>

    <p><i>Enter Mariners</i></p>

    <p>
    <h5>Boatswain</h5>
    Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
    yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
    master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
    if room enough!</p>
    <p><i>Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others</i></p>

    <p>
    <h5>ALONSO</h5>
    Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
    Play the men.</p>
    <p>
    <h5>Boatswain</h5>
    I pray now, keep below.</p>
    <p>
    <h5>ANTONIO</h5>
    Where is the master, boatswain?</p>
    <p>
    <h5>Boatswain</h5>
    Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
    cabins: you do assist the storm.</p>
    <p>
    <h5>GONZALO</h5>
    Nay, good, be patient.</p>
    <p>
    <h5>Boatswain</h5>
    When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
    for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.</p>
    <p>
    <h5>GONZALO</h5>
    Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</p>
    <p>
    <h5>Boatswain</h5>
    None that I more love than myself. You are a
    counsellor; if you can command these elements to
    silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
    not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
    cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
    yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
    the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
    of our way, I say.</p>
    <p><i>Exit</i></p>

    <p>
    <h5>GONZALO</h5>
    I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
    hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
    perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
    hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
    for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
    born to be hanged, our case is miserable.</p>
    <p><i>Exeunt</i></p>

    <p><i>Re-enter Boatswain</i></p>

    <p>
    <h5>Boatswain</h5>
    Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
    her to try with main-course.</p>
    <p><i>A cry within</i></p>

    <p>A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
        the weather or our office.</p>
    <p><i>Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO</i></p>

    <p>Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
        and drown? Have you a mind to sink?</p>
    <p>
    <h5>SEBASTIAN</h5>
    A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
    incharitable dog!</p>
    <p>
    <h5>Boatswain</h5>
    Work you then.</p>
    </p>
